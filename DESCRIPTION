Description: A package developed for HMCTS which provides functionality to make
        recommendations for the number of judges who will need to be hired in
        order to satisfy a given predicted demand. And also to "stress test" that
        recommended hiring profile under a range of different possible future
        demand profiles. Requires parameter inputs prepared and loaded in a
        structured Excel template. Designed as a successor to the Excel-based
        JuST model which was built and maintained by MoJ ASD.
